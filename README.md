FMCW Radar System SimulationInstitution: Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering Course: Signals and SystemsAuthors: Salah Waheed & Islam Ahmed Project OverviewThis project involves the design and simulation of a complete Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar model in MATLAB. The system is designed to simulate an automotive-grade radar (76-77 GHz) capable of detecting multiple moving targets by estimating their range and velocity simultaneously through 2D signal processing.+2System SpecificationsThe radar parameters were selected to achieve high-precision detection with a range resolution of 15 cm.ParameterValueCarrier Frequency ($f_c$)76.5 GHz Bandwidth ($B$)1 GHz Chirp Duration ($T_c$)3 $\mu$s Sampling Frequency ($F_s$)2 GHz Range Resolution ($\Delta R$)0.15 m Velocity Resolution ($\Delta v$)0.45 m/s Max Unambiguous Range ($R_{max}$)~450 m Max Unambiguous Velocity ($V_{max}$)~116 m/s Implementation MethodologyThe simulation is divided into four primary tasks to model the full radar signal chain:Task A: Signal GenerationTransmitted Signal: Generates a Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) "chirp" signal.+1Target Modeling: Simulates two moving targets with specific range and velocity profiles.+1Noise Injection: Incorporates Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to simulate realistic environmental conditions at SNR levels of 5, 10, and 15 dB.+1Task B: Range DetectionMixing (De-chirping): Multiplies the transmitted signal by the complex conjugate of the received echo to isolate the beat frequency ($f_b$).+11D FFT Processing: Performs a Fast Fourier Transform on the beat signal to extract the range profile.+1Result: Targets are identified at 40m and 120m with sub-centimeter error.Task C: Velocity EstimationSlow-Time Processing: Analyzes the phase shift across 512 consecutive chirps.+2Doppler FFT: Applies a second FFT along the "Slow Time" dimension to calculate relative velocity.+1Task D: Range-Doppler Map (RDM)2D FFT: Implements a full 2D Fourier Transform to resolve targets in both range and velocity dimensions simultaneously.+1Normalization: Normalizes the spectrum to 0 dB to standardize visualization across different SNR levels.Advanced Features (Bonus)Cell-Averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR): An adaptive thresholding algorithm that estimates the local noise floor using training and guard cells to maintain a constant false alarm rate.+1Automated Peak Extraction: Uses statistical local maxima identification to extract precise velocity values without manual cursor placement.+1Simulation ResultsThe system was tested under high-noise conditions (5 dB SNR).Range Accuracy: Detected ranges matched ground truth with an error of $< 1$ cm.Velocity Accuracy: Detected velocities were accurate within approximately 0.5-0.7 m/s, meeting the theoretical resolution limits of the discrete FFT bins.+1ReferencesM.
